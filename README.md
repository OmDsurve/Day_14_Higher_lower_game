# Day_14_Higher_lower_game
I created a 'Higher or Lower' game in Python where users guess which celebrity has more followers on social media. The game compares two randomly selected accounts, displays their details, and asks the user to make a choice. The score increases with correct guesses, and the game ends when a wrong guess is made.
